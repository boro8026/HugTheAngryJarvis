This is a project that was completed during my CISC 230 - Object Oriented Programming & Design course.
I took this course during the first semester of my sophomore year at college. This project was created
in Java, and shows off a multi-threaded program dealing with shared resources. I received top marks for this work.

This game involves moving around a board and trying to catch "Jarvis." The player is moved using the
q,w,e,d,c,x,z,a keys. Moving in the direction of these keys in their relation to the 's' key. The board
is hidden at first, however as the player moves around the board the previously visited cells are reveled.
This allows players to see Jarvis as he moves into previously visited cells.

Jarvis will also lay down "homework traps". If a player is to occupy the same cell as one of these, then the
trap is removed and the player is stuck there for a few seconds. All the while, Jarvis will continue to move.
